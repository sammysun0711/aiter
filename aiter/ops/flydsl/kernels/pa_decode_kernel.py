"""Readable tile-programming reference for paged-attention fp8 decode.

K/V are fp8 e4m3 (FNUZ on gfx942, OCP on gfx950) fed straight into FP8 MFMA;
Q (bf16/f16) and the softmax probabilities P are quantized to fp8 too. Scales
fold out of the matmuls (q/key scale into the QK score, value scale + 1/FP8_MAX
into the epilogue); softmax max/sum stay f32.
The default instruction is ``mfma_f32_16x16x32_fp8_fp8``. Tuned gfx950 BF16
per-token MTP3/MTP4 shapes use K=128 FP8 MFMA atoms, with the same normalized
Q/P values and operand layouts, including query-split MTP4 CTAs.
The tuned gfx950 BF16 scalar-scale decode specialization instead casts Q/P
directly to fp8, without range normalization or the compensating 1/FP8_MAX.
This is a speed/precision tradeoff: small Q values and long probability tails
can round to zero, and Q must fit the fp8 range. Per-token scales retain the
range-normalized Q/P policy.
``key_scale``/``value_scale`` are either a ``[1]`` per-tensor scalar or a
``[num_blocks, num_kv_heads, block_size]`` per-token tensor (chosen by rank).

``block_size`` (16/64/128) and ``head_dim`` (multiple of 64) are compile-time
constants. Layouts are logical, not production's preshuffle.

* ``query``        [num_seqs, num_q_heads, head_dim]  f16/bf16 (head_dim contiguous)
* ``key_cache``    [num_blocks, num_kv_heads, head_dim//16, block_size, 16]  fp8
* ``value_cache``  [num_blocks, num_kv_heads, block_size//16, head_dim, 16] (trans_v)
                   or [num_blocks, num_kv_heads, head_dim, block_size] (plain), by rank
* ``block_tables`` [num_seqs, max_blocks_per_seq]  int32
* ``context_lengths`` [num_seqs]  int32
* ``output``       [num_seqs, num_q_heads, head_dim]  same dtype as query

One CTA (4 waves) per (seq, kv_head, partition, query group) runs online softmax over
256-token blocks; the 4 waves split tokens for Q.KT and head-dim for P.V, with
an LDS round-trip on P transposing ownership between the two MMAs.

    """Select the schedule and cache the PA-decode kernel + launch wrapper.

    Batch/head/CU counts and plan capacity select the schedule. Calls that
    select the same specialization share one kernel and launch wrapper.
    ``query_splits=None`` selects automatically; an explicit count overrides
    splitting while retaining the matching prefetch policy. Planned splitting
    uses a host-known task-count upper bound, without reading GPU metadata.
    Sufficient window capacity also proves that every active planned task has
    one KV tile, selecting a single-iteration specialization.

    ``block_size``, ``head_dim``, and ``query_dtype`` are compile-time
    constants. ``query_length`` (MTP) and ``query_group_size`` flatten into
    ``TOTAL_ROWS = query_length * query_group_size``. ``query_splits`` assigns
    equal groups of query positions to separate CTAs, each processing
    ``M_TILES = ceil(TOTAL_ROWS / query_splits / 16)`` MFMA tiles. The partial
    output layout remains unsplit so the existing FlyDSL reducer can combine
    context partitions without an intermediate transpose.

    The single-tile specialization requires a standard work plan whose
    host-known capacity proves every nonempty record contains one KV tile.
    Padding records still skip the whole task, and partial outputs keep the
    same packed layout and reducer as multi-tile plans.

    Selected split-query, single-tile plans map packed slots over a (B, C/B)
    physical grid. Physical x is not a sequence index: each active task still
    takes its sequence from the plan record. This specialization requires
    positive launch B, capacity C divisible by B, and launch sizes consistent
    with the schedule selection. These runtime size preconditions are checked
    here, not dynamically in the JIT launch. Neither B nor C/B enters the
    kernel specialization-cache key.

    Planned BF16 D128 partial output automatically uses cached 64-bit buffer
    stores on gfx950 when a packed slot's byte span fits a positive signed i32.
    Each descriptor is rebased in i64 to one slot. The view retains only the
    input dtype's 2-byte alignment; offsets inside the slot are multiples of
    8 bytes. Partial statistics and direct output are unchanged.

    A positive ``sliding_window`` includes the query token itself. Planned and
    static schedules cover the union of the MTP windows; scores are masked per
    query row within those tiles.
    ``use_sinks`` adds a per-query-head zero-value attention logit in the final
    epilogue for direct NP=1 output. Partitioned/planned execution instead adds
    it exactly once in the reducer, leaving partial statistics unchanged.

    Tokens at/after ``context_len`` still take part in the PV matmul with a zero
    probability, so their V bytes must be finite: the MFMA does not treat a zero
    operand as an annihilator (``0 * NaN == NaN``). Whole pages past the
    sequence's extent are pinned to block 0 (see ``_load_phys_scalar``); the
    remaining slots are the unwritten tail of the last page the sequence owns,
    which the caller is expected to leave finite.

    ``wide_kv_addressing`` computes K/V element offsets in 64-bit. It is only
    correct-critical once a single cache tensor passes 2 GiB, where the i32
    page-stride product wraps, and it is not free: measured +18% at
    ``block_size=64`` (one page index feeds four step-loads there, so i32 lets
    the page-base multiply be hoisted and the offsets stay 32-bit adds) and
    neutral at ``block_size=16``. The wrapper turns it on from the cache size.
